*Enabling scalable allocation of value.*

## Use cases

- Ownership tables for assets such as music and movies, open source projects
- New models of captable management for corporations / DAOs
- Fund accounting waterfall distribution
- Dynamic oracle-driven incentive mechanics for revenue share, royalties, etc

## How to Run

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Install Foundry by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in three different terminals, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev:testnet
npm run dev:contracts-groupmanagement
npm run dev:frontend
```

This will start the testnet, deploy the GroupManagement contracts, and start the frontend development server.
